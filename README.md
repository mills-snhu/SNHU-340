Client/ Server Development

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 
Using comments for each section in the code allows a user to understand what the code sections are used for. Using public methods and classes allows for inheritence which can adapt to a change ing the parent coding if necessary.   

Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. 
What were the advantages of working in this way? 
This way allows a user to improt the python coed to jupytor notebook and use the python code to interact with the MongoDb database.

How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
This module has the basics for a create, read, update, and delete functions that a can be altered slightly for other collections or databases.


How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? 
By inspection small parts of a code at time An example is; in my project the queries where not working so I commented out all but one query at a time to find the 
'breed' field with multiple values was the place to fix the way the code was written. 


Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. 
How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? 
Grazioso Salvare requested on open source python module to use for other projects

What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
I would create a use the strategies of creating several fields for each entry so a client could reqest a very specific query. 

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
This type of database work allows a customer or companie to find the things, in this case dogs, in a quick manner without having to search an entire collection of thousands of entries.
